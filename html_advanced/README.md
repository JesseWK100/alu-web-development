HTML Advanced: Semantic Webpage Implementation

Project Overview
This project is part of the alu-web-development curriculum, designed to enhance skills in building semantic and accessible HTML structures. You will recreate a webpage entirely in HTML, adhering strictly to the design specifications provided in a Figma file. This project does not involve any styling (CSS) or interactivity (JavaScript), focusing solely on semantic and structural accuracy.

Key Objectives
Recreate the Figma Design: Accurately replicate the structure of the webpage using HTML.
Semantic HTML: Use appropriate HTML5 tags to ensure accessibility and maintain best practices.
No Styling: Concentrate purely on the layout and structure, excluding any CSS or visual design elements.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To complete this project, you’ll need the following tools and resources:

A Figma Account: Create a free Figma account to access the design file.
Fonts:
- Source Sans Pro
- Spin Cycle OT (replace with actual link if available)
A Code Editor: Any text editor, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.

Accessing the Design
- Visit the Figma link provided: https://www.figma.com/design/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=mI0A40dAhZ8ZWBnX-0
- Duplicate the file to your drafts by clicking "Duplicate to your Drafts."
- Review the design details, including spacing, fonts, and layout.

File Structure
The project should be organized as follows:

alu-web-development/
└── html_advanced/
    ├── index.html
    └── README.md

Development Guidelines
- Precision: Ensure your HTML structure aligns closely with the Figma design. Round float values where necessary.
- Semantic Tags: Use meaningful HTML5 tags such as <header>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> to enhance accessibility and readability.
- Valid Markup: Ensure your HTML passes W3C validation (https://validator.w3.org/).

Example Layout Guide
Section	HTML Tag	Description
Header	<header>	Contains the logo and navigation menu.
Main Content	<main>	Holds the central content of the page.
Footer	<footer>	Includes contact information and social links.

Notes and Tips
Font Issues: If your computer lacks the required fonts, download them from the links above and install them locally.
Figma Measurements: When encountering float values in Figma, round them to the nearest whole number unless precision is required.
Keyboard Navigation: Ensure the webpage is accessible via keyboard navigation as a best practice.
